# Simple FRC Pit

The pits for our FRC teams are simplified to just three carts: two workstation carts and a robot cart. 

## Pit Cart.scad

This file is an OpenSCAD sketch of the pit cart. The cart is made of 1/2 inch plywood. It is designed to hold Milwaukee Tool Packout toolboxes. Attach a mounting plate to the bottom of each side compartment, and stack your preferred arrangement of Packout products. The center compartment is for robot batteries. A charger can be mounted behind the robot batteries.  This battery rack is based on the Killer Bees battery cart.
